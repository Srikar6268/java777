'''
Write a program to sort a given sequence of N versions by chronological order. Each version number starts with 'release-' follwed by three fields major, minor and patch with '.' separation(release-major.minor.patch). The '.' character separates fields and it is not a decimal point. Some versions may be pre-released and have suffix ".rcN", rc stands for release candidate and N is an integer.

Input Format

First line consists of number N.

Next N lines consists of names of N versions respectively.

Constraints
