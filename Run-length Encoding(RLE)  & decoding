'''
Run-length Encoding(RLE) is one of the simplest encoding schemes used to compress text data. In RLE, consecutive occurrences of the same characters of text M are replaced by a single character followed by its frequency. As an example, the text AABBBBDAA would be encoded to A2B4D1A2.

Your task is to perform encoding or decoding operations using RLE.
