'''to print avg char of a particular string
Given a string S of length N, your task is to compute the average character. If the average character lies between two integer ASCII values, return the smaller one.

Input Format

First line consists of T - the number of testcases.

Next T lines consists of T testcases, one per line. Each testcase consists of a string S.

Constraints

1 <= len(S) <= 10^4

The string S consists of only printable characters.'''
