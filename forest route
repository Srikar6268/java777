        '''You are walking through a forest, and keeping track of the coordinates of checkpoints. Eventually, you decide you would like to turn back and go home. Can you remember how to get back?

Input Format

The first line of input will be the number of checkpoints C. The next lines will be 2 checkpoint coordinates Cx and Cy. The next line will be the number of queries Q. The next Q lines will be queries in the format of the checkpoint number and the coordinate requested. The checkpoints will be counted starting from 0.

Constraints

1 <= C <= 20

-10 <= Cx,Cy <= 10

1 <= Q <= 20

Output Format

For each query, print the value of the coordinate queried.
